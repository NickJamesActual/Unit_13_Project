# Add commands to ~/.bashrc
# (nano preferable for me; can also be output redirect.)

# Ex: echo "alias lsa='ls -a'" >> ~/.bashrc
# Result: cmd "lsa" = "ls -a"


# Note: source ~/.bashrc
# - to "reload" effectively and bypass immediate restart (best for testing)

# "source" can be appended (see comment below)
# echo ... >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
