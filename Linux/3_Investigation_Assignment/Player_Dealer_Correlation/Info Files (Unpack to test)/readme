I apologize if I include too much information, or did these assignments in a way that isn't efficient enough.

Most of the log files are also included, to hopefully make it simpler to test my scripts.

I may also have misinterpreted some of the instructions, but I can't know for sure, as it seems that some of
the other students are also confused on exactly how we are supposed to execute these scripts.

Regardless, this was a fun activity, and I tried to add a (tiny) slightly more personal touch with the bonus,
which I hope is okay.
